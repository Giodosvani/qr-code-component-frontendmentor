## My process

  -- To make the project the closier possible to the reference, i started understanding the HTML part, organizing what should be, and where it should be. It's a short challenge, so i didn't get too long to do it. After making sure the HTML document where done, i get to CSS file, and started from the Bigger and most obvious problems to the minor ones.
  -- I needed: A big white card, centralized with a image, a title and some text. Using FlexBox it is really easy to make it responsible, so when i leave the "mobile" size on the browser, it worked automatically to bigger screens.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

  -- I'm returning my studies and this challenge helped me to remember how to to get the things done using CSS.
 

```css
:root {
--Slate300: #d6e2f0;
--Slate500: #68778d;
--Slate900: #1f3251;
}
```
